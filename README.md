# ktool

ktool is a simple cli tool i wrote for myself in go,
it contains all my stupid ideas i'm not too lazy to execute 

Despite that you might find it usefull,
~~if you want to know what exactly is availible in the app the documentation is coming soon<sup>TM</sup>~~ *the app now tells you what you can do*

To install this piece of shit compile it yourself with the go toolchain or go to [releases](https://github.com/kociumba/ktool/releases) (notice! this is pretty useless if you don't add the executable to the PATH variable on windows)


for now notes will only work per direcotry instead of system wide on linux and mac 


# note

if you are a developer, fixes to my shit code are more than welcome
