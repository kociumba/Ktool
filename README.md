Ktool is a simple cli tool I wrote for myself in go,
it contains all my stupid ideas I'm not too lazy to execute 

Despite that you might find it usefully,

Instructions for installing Ktool can be found in the [Ktool wiki](https://github.com/kociumba/ktool/wiki)

## Notes

If any antiviruses give a false positive about this app downloading from a raw GitHub link,
this is because the Ktool downloads the [Ksorter.ps1](https://github.com/kociumba/ksorter/blob/main/Ksorter.ps1) script automatically 
from GitHub.

I could have prepackaged Ksorter with Ktool but that would mean Ktool wouldn't always use the latest version of Ksorter.

if you are a developer, fixes to my shit code are more than welcome
