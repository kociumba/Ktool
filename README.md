ktool is a simple cli tool i wrote for myself in go,
it contains all my stupid ideas i'm not too lazy to execute 

Despite that you might find it usefull,

To install this piece of shit compile it yourself with [Go](https://go.dev) or go to [releases](https://github.com/kociumba/ktool/releases) (currently no new build will have an installer, this is subject to change)


for now notes will only work per direcotry instead of system wide on linux and mac

## notes
