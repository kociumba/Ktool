# ktool

ktool is a simple cli tool i wrote for myself in go,
it contains all my stupid ideas i'm not too lazy to execute 

Despite that you might find it usefull,
~~if you what to know what exactly is availible in the app the documentation is coming soon<sup>TM</sup>~~ *the app now tells you what you can do*

To install this piece of shit compile it yourself with the go toolchain or go to [releases](https://github.com/kociumba/ktool/releases) (notice! this is pretty useless if you don't add the executable to the PATH variable on windows)
