# ktool

ktool is a simple cli tool i wrote for myself in go,
it contains all my stupid ideas i'm not too lazy to execute 

Despite that you might find it usefull,

To install this piece of shit compile it yourself with [Go](https://go.dev) or go to [releases](https://github.com/kociumba/ktool/releases) (notice! this is pretty useless if you don't add the executable to the PATH variable on windows)


for now notes will only work per direcotry instead of system wide on linux and mac 

## Features

- shitty sys info readout
- note taking (a bit broken xd)
- currency conversion (racists towards the british rn)
- shitt ls function for listing shit in directories
- the [pricer](https://gabagool.vercel.app/)
- shitty fibonacci sequence I made couse of boredom
- the funny

## Planned

- time zone conversion


## notes

if you are a developer, fixes to my shit code are more than welcome
